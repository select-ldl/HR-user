Q: What's Advanced RAR Repair?
A: Advanced RAR Repair(ARAR) is a powerful tool to repair corrupt RAR or SFX archives. It
   uses advanced technologies to scan the corrupt or damaged RAR or SFX archives and recover
   your data in them as much as possible, so to minimize the loss in file corruption.

Q: What is the current version?
A: The current release version of ARAR is 1.2.

Q: How to determine whether ARAR can repair my RAR or SFX archive successfully, according to
   the results generated by the demo version?
A: Please just use the demo version to repair your RAR or SFX archive normally in "Repair" tab.
   If the files in the archive can be recovered successfully, you will see a messagebox after
   the reparation, where you can click the "Show Recoverable Files" button and see a report of
   all the recoverable files in the RAR archive. For every recoverable file, the report will
   display its file name, file size, the original file size, the recovered file size, the
   recovery ratio, which equals to recovered file size / original file size, and the recoverable
   status.

   According to these information, you can know whether ARAR works on your file and order the full
   version to get the actually recovered files.
   
Q: What's the meaning of the recoverable status in the demo report?
A: In the demo report, if the recoverable status of a file is "Fully Recoverable", the all data in
   that file can be recovered completely.
   
   If the recoverable status is "Partially Recoverable", the only part of the data in that file
   can be recovered.

   If the recoverable status is "Not Recoverable", then the data in that file cannot be recovered.
